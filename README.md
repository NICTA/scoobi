## Welcome!
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NICTA/scoobi.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NICTA/scoobi)
[Hadoop MapReduce](http://hadoop.apache.org/) is awesome, but it seems a little bit crazy when you have to write [this](http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/WordCount) to count words. Wouldn't it be nicer if you could simply write what you want to do:

```scala
val lines = fromTextFile("hdfs://in/...")

val counts = lines.flatMap(_.split(" "))
                .map(word => (word, 1))
                .groupByKey
                .combine(_+_)

persist(counts.toTextFile("hdfs://out/...", overwrite=true))
```

This is what Scoobi is all about. Scoobi is a Scala library that focuses on making you more productive at building Hadoop applications. It stands on the functional programming shoulders of Scala and allows you to just write **what** you want rather than **how** to do it.

Scoobi is a library that leverages the Scala programming language to provide a programmer friendly abstraction around Hadoop's MapReduce to facilitate rapid development of analytics and machine-learning algorithms.

### Install

See the [install instructions](http://nicta.github.io/scoobi/guide/com.nicta.scoobi.guide.QuickStart.html#Installing+Scoobi) in the QuickStart section of the [User Guide](http://nicta.github.io/scoobi/guide/com.nicta.scoobi.guide.UserGuide.html).

### Features

 * Familiar APIs - the `DList` API is very similar to the standard Scala `List` API

 * Strong typing - the APIs are strongly typed so as to catch more errors at compile time, a
 major improvement over standard Hadoop MapReduce where type-based run-time errors often occur

 * Ability to parameterise with rich [data types](http://nicta.github.io/scoobi/guide/com.nicta.scoobi.guide.DataTypes.html) - unlike Hadoop MapReduce, which requires that you go off implementing a myriad of classes that implement the `Writable` interface, Scoobi allows `DList` objects to be parameterised by normal Scala types including value types (e.g. `Int`, `String`, `Double`), tuple types (with arbitrary nesting) as well as **case classes**

 * Support for multiple types of I/O - currently built-in support for [text](http://nicta.github.io/scoobi/guide/com.nicta.scoobi.guide.LoadAndPersist.html#Text+files), [Sequence](http://nicta.github.io/scoobi/guide/com.nicta.scoobi.guide.LoadAndPersist.html#Sequence+files) and [Avro](http://nicta.github.io/scoobi/guide/com.nicta.scoobi.guide.LoadAndPersist.html#Avro+files) files with the ability to implement support for [custom sources/sinks](http://nicta.github.io/scoobi/guide/com.nicta.scoobi.guide.LoadAndPersist.html#Custom+input)

 * Optimization across library boundaries - the optimiser and execution engine will assemble Scoobi code spread across multiple software components so you still keep the benefits of modularity

 * It's Scala - being a Scala library, Scoobi applications still have access to those precious Java libraries plus all the functional programming and concise syntax that makes developing Hadoop applications very productive

 * Apache V2 licence - just like the rest of Hadoop

### Getting Started

To get started, read the [getting started steps](http://nicta.github.io/scoobi/guide/com.nicta.scoobi.guide.QuickStart.html) and the section on [distributed lists](http://nicta.github.io/scoobi/guide/com.nicta.scoobi.guide.DistributedLists.html). The remaining sections in the [User Guide](http://nicta.github.io/scoobi/guide/com.nicta.scoobi.guide.UserGuide.html) provide further detail on various aspects of Scoobi's functionality.
