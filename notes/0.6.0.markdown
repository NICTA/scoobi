 * [issue 167](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/167): when using a "lean" jar, the dependent jars can be found from the `$HADOOP_CLASSPATH` variable
 * [issue 167](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/167): upload a jar to the `libjars` directory in the cluster if its size has changed
 * [issue 167](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/167): the `libjars` directory can be changed with a system variable
 * [issue 167](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/167): added a `transpose` method for matrices
 * [issue 167](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/167): added `Grouping`, `Ordering` and `WireFormat` instances for tagged types
 * [issue 167](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/167): added lots of Scoobi debug log statements during the execution of a `ScoobiApp`
 * added [`WireFormat` instances for Shapeless tagged types](http://nicta.github.com/scoobi/api/master/scala/index.html#com.nicta.scoobi.core.WireFormatImplicits)
 * made the `Iterable` returned by `materialise` [lazy](http://nicta.github.com/scoobi/api/master/scala/index.html#com.nicta.scoobi.impl.exec.BridgeStore)
 * tuples of DListPersisters [can be persisted as well](http://nicta.github.com/scoobi/api/master/scala/index.html#com.nicta.scoobi.application.Persister$)
 * support for `WireFormats` with [up to 22 arguments in tuples and case classes](http://nicta.github.com/scoobi/api/master/scala/index.html#com.nicta.scoobi.core.WireFormatImplicits)
 * extended the `DataSink` api to declare that [outputs must be compressed](http://nicta.github.com/scoobi/api/master/scala/index.html#com.nicta.scoobi.io.DataSink)
 * a `DMatrix` can be [multiplied by a function](http://nicta.github.com/scoobi/api/master/scala/index.html#com.nicta.scoobi.lib.LinearAlgebra$)

### Changes
