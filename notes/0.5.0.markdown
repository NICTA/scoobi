### New Features

 * added a full outer join to the relational library
 * refactored the ScoobiApp trait with several [command-line options](http://nicta.github.com/scoobi/guide/Application.html#Application)
 * added a `keepfiles` argument for testing to be able to inspect temporary files
 * [issue 85](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/85) set the minimum and maximum number of reducers
 * now a Scoobi job fails when an intermediate Hadoop job fails
 * added more logging and a url to the job on the job tracker when there is a failure

 * [issue 129](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/129): added the ability to set the input size threshold per reducer

### Changes

 * restructured the code so that "core" classes like DList, DObject go to a `com.nicta.scoobi.core` package while application-level classes like `ScoobiApp` or `ScoobiConfiguration` go to `com.nicta.scoobi.application`
 * using sbt 0.12.0
 * there are now 2 main builds for Scoobi: the master branch builds a Scoobi version for cdh4 and there is a separate cdh3 branch using the cdh3 jars
 * [issue 97](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/97): upgraded to avro 1.7.0 on the cdh3 branch
 * Avro can't be used with cdh4 yet because of an Avro bug
 * [issue 122](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/122): disabled the implicit definition creating a default `WireFormat` based on Java serialisation
 * removed the sbt-scoobi plugin in favor of the use of the [sbt-assembly plugin](http://nicta.github.com/scoobi/guide/Deployment.html#Deployment)
