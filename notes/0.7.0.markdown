This is a greatly refactored and enhanced version!

### New Features

 * new API for persisting `DLists` and `DObjects`
 * "Checkpoints" to save intermediary results (with customisable expiry policy)
 * Scoobi REPL to run experiments with your cluster
 * `Reduction` datatype and combinators to create combiner functions
 * Hadoop `Counters` can be used in `parallelDo` operations
 * works on Scala 2.10 
 * refactored the ScoobiApp trait with several [command-line options](http://nicta.github.com/scoobi/guide/Application.html#Application)
 * "map-only" jobs don't use a reducer

### Improvements

 * new `DList` methods: `shuffle`, `isEqualTo`, `stratify`, `zipWithIndex`, `diff`, `distinctDiff`
 * `DObjects` can be saved and loaded
 * `joinFullOuter` operation in the relational library
 * a Scoobi job fails when an intermediate Hadoop job fails
 * added more logging and a url to the job on the job tracker when there is a failure
 * added type/schema checking in Sequence and Avro datasources
 * a `DList` can now be created with `Text` elements (or any `Writable`)
 * input checks can be customised when reading files
 * [#85](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/85) set the minimum and maximum number of reducers
 * [#129](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/129): added the ability to set the input size threshold per reducer
 * [#193](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/193): a `DList` can be used in a `for` comprehension
 * [#235](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/235): new `WireFormat` for Generic Avro records

### Changes

 * `Grouping` definitions must now return `scalaz.Ordering` values instead of just `ints`
 * `combine` operations now take in a `Reduction` object instead of a function. See the `Reduction` object for a list of combinators to create `Reductions`

### Fixes

 * fixed the computation of splits when creating a ChannelInputFormat
 * [#183](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/183): fixed `DList.distinct`
 * [#200](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/200): Enable use '\001' for separator of TextDelimitedFile
 * [#211](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/211): better display of file sizes
 * [#239](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/211): FileUtil.copy in mixed S3/HDFS
