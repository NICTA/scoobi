@dibblego right. I'll be happy to discuss the subject in the future with you on some real example because this has been bugging me lately
@dibblego probably, but all sorts of constraints force you to accept that as arbitrary if you want to complete your programming *now*
@dibblego some of the rules were only there for political reasons. That'd be hard (and unproductive) to model
@etorreborre @dibblego unless you find a mathematical model for humanity...

@anneveling a "loose" block lives inside the class body as any expression. It's valid whether it's alone or returned by a method
@anneveling so eventually I might be able to provide warnings, but I don't know how to be completely fool-proof
@anneveling ... but I don't think that would work either given the current API
@anneveling I tried to think of something where I might count the "fragments" creation and reconcile with the actual number,...
@anneveling that's a good idea indeed but you could still have an intermediate end, then a "forgotten" block (even with another end)
@anneveling btw this is an interesting class of errors with FP in a hybrid language like #scala. I had this error in other contexts too
@anneveling anyway thx for your feedback, please tell me if you find anything else
@anneveling yes, hard to fight that one. You can still use the "mutable" style to avoid that. I'm actually using it a lot more recently
