/*
 * A closed, binary operation on a set. Implementations may benefit by adhering to the law of associativity, however,
 * this is *not* mandatory.
 *
 * Associativity
 * =============
 * Implementations of the `Reduction` trait supply a value for the reduce operation: (A, A) => A.
 * This is typically done using the existing `Reduction` values,
 * however a user can supply their own with the `Reduction#apply` function.
 *
 * This function is described as:
 * - binary, since it accepts 2 arguments.
 * - closed, since that operation accepts and returns arguments of the same type (set).
 * - implementations may satisfy the law of associativity.
 *
 * The associativity law on the `reduce` operation is given by:
 * âˆ€ x y z. reduce(reduce(x, y), z) = reduce(x, reduce(y, z))
 *
 * Equivalence is defined here by extensional equivalence.
 *
 * Implementers can check adherence to the law of associativity given by the `Reduction#associative` method.
 * For a given Reduction (`r`), `r.associative(x, y, z)` always returns `true` if it is associative.
 * (within the bounds of extensional equivalence).
