### Creation

Scoobi provides several traits to help building applications. `ScoobiApp` brings them all together:

```scala
object WordCount extends ScoobiApp {
  def run() {
    val lines = DList(repeat("hello" -> 3, "world" -> 4):_*)

    val frequencies = lines.flatMap(_.split(" "))
      .map(word => (word, 1))
      .groupByKey
      .combine((a: Int, b: Int) => a + b).materialize

    println(persist(frequencies).toList.sorted)
  }

  /** @return a Seq of strings where each key has been duplicated a number of times indicated by the value */
  def repeat(m: (String, Int)*): Seq[String] = m.flatMap { case (k, v) => Seq.fill(v)(k) }
}
```

When you extend the `ScoobiApp` trait:

  * you need to implement the `run` method with your Scoobi logic

  * if you create an object, you get a `main(arguments: Array[String])` method to run your code from the command-line: `run-main examples.WordCount`

  * you inherit the command-line arguments in a variable named `args`

  * you inherit an implicit `ScoobiConfiguration` object, for persisting `DLists`. The `ScoobiConfiguration` object encapsulates a Hadoop `Configuration` object setup with the Hadoop command-line arguments, and is accessible through the `configuration` variable.

### Arguments

ScoobiApp provides support for passing in Hadoop-configuration and Scoobi-configuration arguments, which are stripped from the command line prior to being made available in the `args` variable.

The format of the command line is as follows:

  `COMMAND-TO-INVOKE-PROGRAM [HADOOP-ARGS ...] [APPLICATION-ARGS ...] [-- scoobi VALUE1.VALUE2.VALUE3]`

where `COMMAND-TO-INVOKE-PROGRAM` is the invocation needed to run the program, `HADOOP-ARGS` are optional arguments to configure Hadoop, `APPLICATION-ARGS` are the arguments to the application itself, and everything else specifies arguments to configure Scoobi.  Note that both the Hadoop-configuration and Scoobi-configuration arguments are optional.

A simple example that runs an application `mypackage.MyApp` using `sbt run-main` with application arguments `input-dir output-dir` and without any configuration-level arguments is:

  `sbt run-main mypackage.MyApp input-dir output-dir`

A more complicated example is as follows:

  `sbt run-main mypackage.MyApp -Dmapred.max.map.failures.percent=20 -Dmapred.max.reduce.failures.percent=20 --by-time input-dir output-dir -- scoobi warn.times`

This command contains the following sets of arguments:

1. The arguments `-Dmapred.max.map.failures.percent=20 -Dmapred.max.reduce.failures.percent=20` are handled by Hadoop. (They allow for 20% of the map or reduce tasks to fail and the job as a whole to still succeed.)
2. The arguments `--by-time input-dir output-dir` are passed to the application itself.
3. The arguments `warn.times` are handled by Scoobi. (They set the log level to WARN and cause logging of execution time.)

The various sets of arguments are accessible from the `ScoobiApp` with the following variables:

1. `args`: The application arguments.
2. `scoobiArgs`: The Scoobi-configuration arguments, split on ".".
3. `commandLineArguments`: The entire set of command-line arguments.

#### Scoobi Configuration Arguments

The following are the possible configuration arguments for Scoobi:


 Name           | Default value                    | Description
 ---------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------
 verbose        | true                             | if defined, log statements are displayed
 quiet          | false                            | if defined, log statements are not displayed
 times          | false                            | if defined the total execution time is logged
 level          | info                             | minimum level of statements to log
 category       | .*                               | regular expression. By default everything is logged. Use `scoobi` to display only Scoobi logs
 local          | false                            | if defined, run the Scoobi job locally
 inmemory       | false                            | if defined, run the Scoobi job in memory backed up by Scala collections instead of Hadoop
 deletelibjars  | false                            | if defined, remove jars from the `libjars` directory before uploading them again
 nolibjars      | false                            | if defined, do not upload dependent jars to the `libjars` directory and include the Scoobi jar in the job jar
 useconfdir     | false                            | if defined, use the configuration files in `$HADOOP_HOME/conf` (useful when running apps from inside sbt)
 keepfiles      | false                            | if defined, temp files and working directory files are not deleted after the job execution (only for testing)

The list of possible log levels is `all`, `fatal`, `info`, `warn`, `trace`, `off`.

It is also possible to change configuration values by overriding methods in `ScoobiApp`.

### Dependencies

Based on how you package your Scoobi application, Scoobi will try to determine what is the best way to find your dependencies and to add them to the classpath:

 1. if you build a "fat" jar containing the application code plus all the dependent jars (see the [Deployment](Deployment.html) page), Scoobi will get all entries in this jar and add them to a "Job" jar that is distributed to all nodes on the cluster. The drawback of this method is that all the dependencies are sent to the cluster each time the application is executed

 2. if you build a "slim" jar with only the application code or execute from inside sbt, Scoobi will find the dependent jars by introspecting the classloader and try to upload them to a directory on the cluster, then to distribute them to each node. This will be done only once to speed-up the development cycle

For each of those 2 options, you can still alter Scoobi behavior by passing command-line arguments or by overriding some methods of the `ScoobiApp` trait

#### "Fat" jar

Scoobi determines if a jar is a "fat" jar by:

 1. determining which class is used to run the application (a class extending `ScoobiApp`)
 2. finding the jar containing this class
 3. checking if this jar contains the "scoobi" jar (in a `lib` directory for example if packaged using sbt-assembly) or some Scoobi classes

In this case all jar entries will be copied to a job-specific jar distributed to each node before the Scoobi job execution.

#### Dependencies uploading

Dependencies are being uploaded to the cluster if Scoobi determines that you are not using a "fat" jar:

 1. the dependent jars are taken from the context classloader and are only loaded if they come from a `.ivy2` or `.m2` directory (the Hadoop jars are *not* included)

 2. the jars are uploaded to a directory on the cluster. By default this directory is named `libjars` and only new jars are uploaded.

 3. *all* those dependencies are added to the `mapred.classpath` Hadoop configuration variable

If you don't want to use this facility at all (or if Scoobi fails to recognize your jar as a "fat" jar), you can override the `upload` method and set it to `false` or pass `scoobi nolibjars` on the command line.

#### `LibJars` usage

The functionalities for managing dependencies reside in methods of the `LibJars` trait which can be reused independently from the `ScoobiApp` trait, or overidden:

 1. `jars` defines the list of jars to upload
 2. `uploadLibJarFiles` uploads the new jars to the `libjars` directory
 3. `libJarsDirectory` defines the name of the directory containing the dependent jars
 4. `deleteJars` removes all existing jars in the `libjars` directory if one of your dependencies has changed (but kept the same name)

Here is an example on how to use these methods:

```scala
package mypackage

object MyApp extends ScoobiApp {
  def run() {
    // remove the existing jars on the cluster
    deleteJars
    // upload the dependencies to the cluster
    uploadLibJarFiles

    // define and execute a Scoobi job
    val lines = ...
  }
}
```

### Configuration

The `ScoobiApp` trait can be used in 2 different contexts:

  1. with the `hadoop jar` command

    In that case, `hadoop` finds the cluster location by either using the configuration files in its `conf` directory or by using the `fs` and `jt` arguments

  2. within sbt

    In that case the cluster location can be either defined by using the `useconfdir` command line argument to get the configuration files found in `$HADOOP_HOME/conf` directory
    You can also override the `fs` and `jobTracker` methods, and get those values from your own properties file.

### Local execution

For testing, it can useful to run Scoobi applications locally only:

 - if you are using the `hadoop jar` command, you can specify a local configuration by either using the `fs`/`jt` arguments
 - if you are using sbt, you can pass the "`scoobi local`" argument for a local execution
 - if you are using sbt, you can pass the "`scoobi inmemory`" argument for a fast execution backed up by Scala collections instead of Hadoop

### Logging

By default, when extending the `Hadoop` trait, Hadoop and Scoobi logs will be shown in the console at the "INFO" level. However for debugging failed jobs you may want to change the log level or the log categories:

 * show some log levels: `run-main mypackage.MyApp [ARGS] -- scoobi warn` (you can also override the `level` method). The log levels are the ones from the Apache commons logging library: `ALL`, `FATAL`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `TRACE`

 * show some log categories: `run-main mypackage.MyApp [ARGS] -- scoobi warn.(hadoop|scoobi)` will only display the log lines where the category matches `.*(hadoop|scoobi).*`. Note that you can visually separate this regular expression for log categories with brackets to help the reading: `run mypackage.MyApp -- scoobi.warn.[(hadoop|scoobi)].times`

 * you can additionally show the execution times, locally and on the cluster: `run-main mypackage.MyApp -- scoobi times` (or override the `showTimes` method)

 * finally you can combine those flags: `run-main mypackage.MyApp [ARGS] -- scoobi warn.times`

Note that logs can be turned off by using the 'quiet' argument:  `run-main mypackage.MyApp [ARGS] -- scoobi quiet` (you can also override the `quiet` method to return `true`)
