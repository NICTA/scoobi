<notoc><h4>Scoobi - Bringing the productivity of Scala to Hadoop</h4></notoc>

[Hadoop MapReduce](http://hadoop.apache.org/) is awesome, but it seems a little bit crazy when you have to write [this](http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/WordCount) to count words. Wouldn't it be nicer if you could simply write what you want to do:

    val lines = fromTextFile("hdfs://in/...")

    val counts = lines.flatMap(_.split(" "))
                      .map(word => (word, 1))
                      .groupByKey
                      .combine(_+_)

    persist(toTextFile(counts, "hdfs://out/..."))

This is what Scoobi is all about. Scoobi is a Scala library that focuses on making you more productive at building Hadoop applications. It stands on the functional programming shoulders of Scala and allows you to just write **what** you want rather than **how** to do it.

Scoobi is a library that leverages the Scala programming language to provide a programmer friendly abstraction around Hadoop's MapReduce to facilitate rapid development of analytics and machine-learning algorithms.
