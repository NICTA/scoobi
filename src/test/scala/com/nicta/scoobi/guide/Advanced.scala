### Configuration Options

Scoobi allows you to configure a few useful runtime settings:

* Use a non-standard working directory by passing `-Dscoobi.workdir` to a `ScoobiApp`
* Set an upper-bound on the amount of reducers scoobi will use with `ScoobiConfiguration.setMaxReducers`
* Set a lower-bound on the amount of reducers scoobi use with `ScoobiConfiguration.setMinReducers`
* Set the amount of reducers scoobi picks, with `ScoobiConfiguration.setBytesPerReducer` (Note: this is based on the input to a MapReduce job, not the input to the reducer. Default is 1GiB)

Look in `ScoobiConfiguration` for other useful runtime configuration options

### Static References

Values or objects that are behind a final static variable or reference won't get serialized properly. They get serialized in their initial state, not their current state. Very often this initial state might be null (for references) and 0 for Ints etc. So our recommendation is to not use them at all. And to avoid hitting the problem, don't use DelayedInit (it internally works with them) and always prefer a `val` to a `var` (especially considering variables are not shared between map-reduce jobs)


### DList Covariance

At the moment DList is not covariant (that is, a `DList[Apple]` is not a `DList[Fruit]`). This is something we're slowly working on, but is quite a large issue because of its flow-on effects"""
