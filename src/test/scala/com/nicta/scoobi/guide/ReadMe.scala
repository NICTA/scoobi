[Hadoop MapReduce](http://hadoop.apache.org/) is awesome, but it seems a little bit crazy when you have to write [this](http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/WordCount) to count words. Wouldn't it be nicer if you could simply write what you want to do:

```scala
val lines = fromTextFile("hdfs://in/...")

val counts = lines.flatMap(_.split(" "))
                .map(word => (word, 1))
                .groupByKey
                .combine(_+_)

persist(toTextFile(counts, "hdfs://out/...", overwrite=true))
```

This is what Scoobi is all about. Scoobi is a Scala library that focuses on making you more productive at building Hadoop applications. It stands on the functional programming shoulders of Scala and allows you to just write **what** you want rather than **how** to do it.

Scoobi is a library that leverages the Scala programming language to provide a programmer friendly abstraction around Hadoop's MapReduce to facilitate rapid development of analytics and machine-learning algorithms.

### Install

See the [install instructions](${SCOOBI_GUIDE_OFFICIAL_PAGE}/Quick%20Start.html#Installing+Scoobi) in the QuickStart section of the [User Guide](${SCOOBI_GUIDE_OFFICIAL_PAGE}/User%20Guide.html).

### Features

 * Familiar APIs - the `DList` API is very similar to the standard Scala `List` API

 * Strong typing - the APIs are strongly typed so as to catch more errors at compile time, a
 major improvement over standard Hadoop MapReduce where type-based run-time errors often occur

 * Ability to parameterize with rich [data types](${SCOOBI_GUIDE_OFFICIAL_PAGE}/Data%20Types.html) - unlike Hadoop MapReduce, which requires that you go off implementing a myriad of classes that implement the `Writable` interface, Scoobi allows `DList` objects to be parameterized by normal Scala types including value types (e.g. `Int`, `String`, `Double`), tuple types (with arbitrary nesting) as well as **case classes**

 * Support for multiple types of I/O - currently built-in support for [text](${SCOOBI_GUIDE_OFFICIAL_PAGE}/Input%20and%20Output.html#Text+files), [Sequence](${SCOOBI_GUIDE_OFFICIAL_PAGE}/Input%20and%20Output.html#Sequence+files) and [Avro](${SCOOBI_GUIDE_OFFICIAL_PAGE}/Input%20and%20Output.html#Avro+files) files with the ability to implement support for [custom sources/sinks](${SCOOBI_GUIDE_OFFICIAL_PAGE}/Input%20and%20Output.html#Custom+sources+and+sinks)

 * Optimization across library boundaries - the optimizer and execution engine will assemble Scoobi code spread across multiple software components so you still keep the benefits of modularity

 * It's Scala - being a Scala library, Scoobi applications still have access to those precious Java libraries plus all the functional programming and consise syntax that makes developing Hadoop applications very productive

 * Apache V2 licence - just like the rest of Hadoop
