### Prerequisites

Before starting, you will need:

* [Cloudera's Hadoop 4.0.1 (CDH4)](http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop/)
* [Sbt 0.12.3](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)

In addition to Hadoop, scoobi uses [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org) (version 0.12.3) to simplify building and packaging a project for running on Hadoop.
  
### Directory Structure  
  
Here the steps to get started on your own project:

```
$$ mkdir my-app
$$ cd my-app
$$ mkdir -p src/main/scala
```

We first can create a `build.sbt` file that has a dependency on Scoobi:

```scala
name := "MyApplication"

version := "1.0"

scalaVersion := "2.10.1"

libraryDependencies += "com.nicta" %% "scoobi" % "$VERSION"

resolvers ++= Seq("cloudera" at "https://repository.cloudera.com/content/repositories/releases",
                  "Sonatype-snapshots" at "http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots")
```

### Write your code

Now we can write some code. In `src/main/scala/myfile.scala`, for instance: ${snippet{
import com.nicta.scoobi.Scoobi._
import Reduction._

object WordCount extends ScoobiApp {
  def run() {
    val lines = fromTextFile(args(0))

    val counts = lines.mapFlatten(_.split(" "))
      .map(word => (word, 1))
      .groupByKey
      .combine(Sum.int)
    counts.toTextFile(args(1)).persist
  }
}
}}

### Running

The Scoobi application can now be compiled and run using sbt:

```
> sbt compile
> sbt "run-main mypackage.myapp.WordCount input-files output"
```

Your Hadoop configuration will automatically get picked up, and all relevant JARs will be made available.

If you had any trouble following along, take a look at [Word Count](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/tree/$BRANCH/examples/wordCount) for a self contained example."""
