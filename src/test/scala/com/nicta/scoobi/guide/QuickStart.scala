### Prerequisites

Before starting, you will need:

* [Cloudera's Hadoop 0.20.2 (CDH3)](http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop/)
* [Sbt 0.12.0](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki)

In addition to Hadoop, scoobi uses [sbt](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki) (version 0.12.0) to simplify building and packaging a project for running on Hadoop. We also provide an sbt plugin [sbt-scoobi](https://github.com/NICTA/sbt-scoobi) to allow you to contain a self-contained JAR for hadoop.
  
### Directory Structure  
  
Here the steps to get started on your own project:

```
$ mkdir my-app
$ cd my-app
$ mkdir -p src/main/scala
```

We first can create a `build.sbt` file that has a dependency on Scoobi:

```scala
name := "MyApp"

version := "0.1"

scalaVersion := "2.9.2"

libraryDependencies += "com.nicta" %% "scoobi" % "${SCOOBI_VERSION}"

scalacOptions ++= Seq("-Ydependent-method-types", "-deprecation")

resolvers += "Sonatype-snapshots" at "http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"
```

### Write your code

Now we can write some code. In `src/main/scala/myfile.scala`, for instance:

```scala
package mypackage.myapp

import com.nicta.scoobi.Scoobi._

object WordCount extends ScoobiApp {
  def run() {
    val lines = fromTextFile(args(0))

    val counts = lines.flatMap(_.split(" "))
                      .map(word => (word, 1))
                      .groupByKey
                      .combine((a: Int, b: Int) => a + b)
    
    persist(toTextFile(counts, args(1)))
  }
}
```  

### Running

The Scoobi application can now be compiled and run using sbt:

```
> sbt compile
> sbt run-main mypackage.myapp.WordCount input-files output
```

Your Hadoop configuration will automatically get picked up, and all relevant JARs will be made available.

If you had any trouble following along, take a look at [Word Count](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/tree/${SCOOBI_BRANCH}/examples/wordCount) for a self contained example."""
