The Exceptions trait provides functional ways to catch exceptions and deal with them:

* tryo returns the result in an Option
* trye returns the result in an Either with the Left value being a function of the exception
* catchAll is similar to trye but even catches Throwables
* tryOr returns the result or a value built from the thrown exception
* catchAllOr is similar to tryOr but even catches Throwables
* tryOrElse returns the result or a default value
* tryMap returns different values depending on the success of the expression
* tryOk returns true iff the expression doesn't throw an Exception
