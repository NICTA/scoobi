 A sequence can be splitted into several smaller ones
 ${ split(Seq(), 3, Splitted)           === Seq()                                                                 }

 ${ split(Seq(1, 2, 3), 3, Splitted)    === Seq(Splitted(0, 3, Seq(1, 2, 3)))                                     }

 A sequence can be partitioned into transitive-closure groups
   for each element in a group, there exists at least another related element in the group  ${g1.e1}
   for each element in a group, there doesn't exist a related element in any other group    ${g1.e2}
   2 elements which are not related must end up in different groups                         ${g1.e3}
   each element in the group must be reachable from another element                         ${g1.e4}
   all elements must end up in a group                                                      ${g1.e5}

 It is possible to take elements of a sequence until one verifies a predicate               ${g2.e1}
 all elements are taken if none of them verifies the predicate                              ${g2.e2}
                                                                                            """
